\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

This section situates \gls{dylam} within the relevant literature. As our approach originates from a \gls{morl}-inspired perspective, this review covers foundational studies in that domain as well as advancements in sample-efficient \gls{rl}, which is the primary objective of our method.

We structure this review into two parts. First, we revisit the seminal contribution of \cite{russell2003q}, which fundamentally shifted the handling of reward specification in reinforcement learning. Second, we survey representative \gls{morld} approaches that directly informed our methodological design.
