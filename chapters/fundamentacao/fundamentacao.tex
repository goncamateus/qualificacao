\chapter{Theoretical Background}
\label{chap:background}
This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of reinforcement learning and the formal elements required to describe agent–environment interaction. Subsequently, we examine two major families of learning algorithms: \emph{value-based methods}, which rely on estimating value functions to derive optimal policies, and \emph{policy gradient methods}, which directly optimize the policy through gradient-based approaches. Together, these sections provide the theoretical and algorithmic basis necessary to understand and develop reinforcement learning solutions.
