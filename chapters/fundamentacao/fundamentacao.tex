\chapter{Theoretical Background}
\label{chap:background}
In this chapter, we provide a brief introduction for the subjects we will treat along this work. We first introduce what is an Artificial Neural Network. Second, we show the fundaments of Reinforcement Learning, then its extension to Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning. Finally the state-of-the-art framework for creating reinforcement learning environments.
