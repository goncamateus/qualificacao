\chapter{Experimental Setup}

This chapter describes the experimental protocol adopted to evaluate the proposed DyLam framework. We first present the software frameworks employed to construct both standard reinforcement learning (\gls{rl}) and multi-objective reinforcement learning (\gls{morl}) environments, highlighting the design choices that enable reproducibility and fair comparison across methods. 

Subsequently, we detail the environments used in the experimental evaluation, emphasizing their structural properties, reward decompositions, and the specific challenges they pose to learning algorithms. These environments were selected to assess DyLam under varying levels of complexity and objective interaction, allowing us to analyze its behavior in both controlled and increasingly realistic scenarios.

Together, these components establish a consistent experimental foundation for the analyses and results discussed in the following chapters.
