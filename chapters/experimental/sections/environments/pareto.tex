\subsection{Pareto-Oriented Setups}
\label{sec:pareto_oriented_setups}

As discussed above, we aim to analyze DyLam’s ability to explore both the Pareto front and the associated weight space. To this end, we consider two well-established environments in the \gls{morl} literature~\cite{abels2019dynamicweightsmultiobjectivedeep, alegre2023sample, felten_toolkit_2023}.
